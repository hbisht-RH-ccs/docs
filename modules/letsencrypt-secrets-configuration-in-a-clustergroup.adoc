[id="letsencrypt-secrets-configuration-in-a-clustergroup"]
= Letsencrypt secrets configuration in a ClusterGroup

The `letsencrypt` parameter configures the use of Letsencrypt for obtaining and managing SSL certificates. This ensures OpenShift clusters have valid SSL certificates, replacing the default self-signed certificates. In regular production environments, clusters are expected to be deployed using an organizationâ€™s own certificates, instead of default self-signed ones. Letsencrypt, a popular service providing trusted certificates for web services, eliminates browser security warnings and errors caused by self-signed certificates.

The certificates requested by letsencrypt come from the `global.localClusterDomain` setting.

*Support Level*

* *AWS Only*: Letsencrypt integration is currently supported only on AWS environments within the validated patterns framework. 

.Example:

*Enabling letsencrypt support*

To enable Let's Encrypt support, add the following entries to `values-AWS.yaml` in the pattern root directory. Be sure to adjust the `region:` and `email:` settings as needed:
